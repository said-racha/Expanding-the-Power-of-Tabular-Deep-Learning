In this project, we reimplement the TabM model and propose several experiments and improvements to its architecture. 
This model is introduced by Yury Gorishniy, Akim Kotelnikov, and Artem Babenko in the paper [TabM: Advancing Tabular Deep Learning with Parameter-Efficient Ensembling](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sd4wYYOhmY), which has been accepted at ICLR 2025.
